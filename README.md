# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization, and it actually summarizes in the form of project all materials that have been learned during this specialization.
## :page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX stands as the most successful company of the commercial space age, revolutionizing space travel by making it more affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost reduction is largely due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the rocket's first stage. Consequently, if we can predict whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, we aim to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
## :page_facing_up: Questions to be answered 
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
## :page_facing_up: Methodology
  ### 1. Data collection methodology
  - Using SpaceX Rest API
  - Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
  ### 2. Performed data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
  ### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
  - Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best
  results
